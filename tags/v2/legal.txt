The file records some legal declaration about my patch `gcc symbol database'
abbr. symdb.

All of the patch is finished by myself individually, I means everything --
database design, documentation, code and patch conception etc. The patch is
applied on gcc 4.4.0 and need sqlite 3.6.10 as I firstly published at
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2009-11/msg01325.html. However sqlite itself
doesn't belong to gcc organization -- www.sqlite.org for more!

All code, database initialization file (init.sql) are published on <GNU
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007>, see gcc.source/COPYING3.
Document symdb.txt, also at gcc/doc/symdb.txt is applied to <GNU Free
Documentation License Version 1.3, 3 November 2008>, see
