// Purpose <([{
The file is used to record the idea I got -- collecting gcc internal data
(definition, file-dependence etc.) and outputting them into database for
further usage.  Have you knowed cscope? but I think it's more appropriate that
symbols should be collected by gcc itself. Later sections can be cataloged
into two genres

For user (here user is IDE-like develop tools, not final user)
1) Need to know what symdb can do, goto section <Feature List>.
2) Goto section <User Manual> for how to using symdb.
3) <Multiple results> and <Tested cases> have more about the plugin.
For gcc internal developer
1) Section <New Token Type> defines some new token types used in my symdb.
2) Sections <Gcc XXXX Macro Expansion> shows some complex cases linking to
macro expansion, I list calling sequence from plugin-side and stack snapshot
from gcc-side in every section, read them carefully, it's the key to
understand so.c:class mo.  test/testplan.txt and test/macro have the
testcases.
3) Section <Patch Overview> makes focus on which files and how are changed in
the patch.

Before we go, let's clear up some terminology or abbreviation used in my symdb
1) cpp abbreviates from c preprocess (follows gcc intern convention); however,
cxx represents c++.
2) In gcc/c-ppoutput.c, gcc defines compilation unit as compiling a file, new
noun `compilation session' means compiling all files of a project.
// }])>

For User
// Feature List <([{
1) The plugin only works on C not C++.
2) Plugin can collect all extern definitins and dump them to database.
3) As the convention, the members of an extern enum are collected and dumped
to database.
4) Funtion call relationship are collected too, just like cscope.
5) You can use table FileDependence of database to reconstruct file dependence
relationship.
6) Not in cscope, you can use `gs addsym/rmsym' to re-edit the database,
remove the duplicate results and append new symbols to the database, see
section <Multiple-results ...>.
7) I finished a vim script `helper.vim' to help you using the database in vim.
8) My plugin is better than cscope in any cases, since I can catch definition
after macro expansion (such as tell you where `sys_open' is defined in linux
source) and skip `#ifdef/#if'.
// }])>

// User Manual <([{
Note: Using my plugin on correct code, buggy code maybe cause my plugin
infinite-loop.

Prepare stage (patch on gcc-4.6.3):
1) cp gcc.patches/* gcc.src/patches
2) quilt push -a
3) make # as usual
More about compilation suite (such as crosstool-ng-1.13.2):
1) Since gcc plugin is implemented as shared library, so disable compiling
static toolchain option.
2) add `--enable-plugin' to your gcc configure line, or append
`CT_CC_GCC_ENABLE_PLUGINS=y' to your crossng.config.
3) See section <Tested cases> for a sample command line on gcc-4.6.3.

Compiling source by patched gcc (cd myplugin.src/):
1) make
2) cp gs helper.vim init.sql target.src/ && cd target.src/
3) ./gs initdb ./ # Initialize database. If you want to custom the plugin,
update plugin-control-fields of database:ProjectOverview.
4) Append `-fplugin=/path/to/symdb.so
-fplugin-arg-symdb-dbfile=/target.src/gccsym.db' to your CFLAGS.
5) Since sqlite uses file-lock to synchronize database, so use `make -j1' to
compile source.
6) It will cost more time to compile your project, because my plugin need
compare whether a token has been inserted into database and multi-core can't
help you -- see previous steps, do it overnight.
7) ./gs vacuumdb ./ # Rearrange and defrag your database.
Of course, you can use some short-cuts to compile your projects without any
modification.
    alias gcc='gccplugin -fplugin=symdb.so -fplugin-arg-symdb-dbfile=gccsym.db'
    alias make='make -j1'

Working with new database:
1) cd /target.src
2) vi
3) execute `:source helper.vim'
4) Using `CTRL-]' to search a definition.
5) Using `CTRL-[' to search which functions calls the function.
6) Using `CTRL-T' to jump back.
7) Using `Gs def yoursymbol' to search a definition.
8) Using `Gs callee yourfunction' to search function call relationship.

Vim quickref:
Since my database stores the file-offset of every token, so
1) Using `:go fileoffset' to jump to the token.
2) Using `g<CTRL-g>' on the char to get the file-offset.

Testing my plugin:
1) cd test && ./run.sh
// }])>

// Multiple-results from my database and my solution <([{
Things are not always perfect, here I list some cases which makes my plugin
return multiple-resuls when search a definition.

    int i;
    int i;
    extern int i;
The syntax is acceped by gcc, so to my plugin, by the way, my plugin doesn't
store the third line to database.

    typedef abc abc;
    struct abc {
        ...
    };
The syntax is correct. `gs' will return two results, one is DEF_TYPEDEF,
another is DEF_STRUCT, however `helper.vim' doesn't distingush them. In
gcc-4.6.2, search `cpp_reader' will see the case, by the way, my script will
search definition from current file and its dependence, then all files, so in
libcpp/internal.h searching `cpp_reader' will return a result.

    #define X a
    #include "afile"
    #undef X
    #define X b
    #include "afile"
    #undef X
Search `X' will return multiple results, gcc/tree.c includes several
gcc/tree.def and definite symbol `DEFTREECODE' several times.

    #ifdef X
    int x;
    #else
    char x;
    #endif
Sometime `x' is returned two results.
glibc-2.13/include/shlib-compat.h:compat_symbol is the case. The reason is
generally every file is compiled two times in glibc internal
    gcc .. -DSHARED .. -o x.os
    gcc .. -o x.o
It causes the strange case.

Fortunately, I add two commands (not in cscope :)
    gs addsym/rmsym filename definition position
So you can remove the item you doesn't like by them. `gs addsym' is also
useful since you can use it to append the symbols which are invisible from my
plugin, such as `gs addsym arch/mips/kernel/vmlinux.lds jiffies 6601'.

// }])>

For Developer
// New Token Type <([{
In this section, I'll define some new token type which is available everywhere
in my symdb, but before we go, we need go further into gcc internal on how gcc
compiles a file, consider the case

    ----------- a.c -----------
    #define FOO \
        = 2;
    // a line comment only.
    ...
    int x FOO;

Now do `gcc -save-temps --verbose a.c', you will get all intermediate files
and gcc call hierarchy -- main, preprocess, compiling, assemble and linkage
stage. Comparing a.c and a.i, we find some tokens are erased, some are
substituted, so my new token types are
1) EXPANDED_TOKEN -- is macro-expanded or substituted (`FOO' of the last
line).
2) ERASED_TOKEN -- erased during preprocess stage (The first 3 lines).
3) COMMON_TOKEN -- exist in both .c and .i.
4) MACRO_TOKEN -- macro result (sample is `=' and `2').

And
*) Original .c/.h include the first 3 types -- also called chToken.
*) .i includes the last 2 types -- called iToken.
*) To function-like macro, such as, `x', `(', `a', `)', all four tokens are
EXPANDED_TOKEN, and the first is also called leader EXPANDED_TOKEN.

By the way, preprocess stage also combines all soft carriage line -- tailing
with `\' into a line, so the first 2 lines are combined, and `\' itself isn't
cpp token.
// }])>

// GCC Cancel Macro Expansion <([{
Consider the case
    #define Z(a) a
    int Z = 3;

in fact, gcc doesn't complain the last line. After prefetch two tokens `Z' and
`=', gcc realizes that `Z' shouldn't be treated as macro, so it cancels macro
expansion and return `Z' and `=' as COMMON_TOKEN not EXPANDED_TOKEN. However
it makes my code flow become more complex, I place a bool mo.cancel to solve
it.
Calling sequence (Note, cb_macro_start and cb_macro_end are always matched
even macro expansion is canceled):
    cb_macro_start(Z)
    cb_end_arg(cancel = true)
    cb_macro_end(Z, prev = NULL)
    symdb_cpp_token('Z')
    symdb_cpp_token('=')
// }])>

// GCC Cascaded Macro Expansion <([{
Consider the case
    #define Z(a) a
    #define Y Z
    #define X Z(1)
    Y(1);
    X;

The case is special due to the expansion process of X and Y is converted to
the expansion process of a fun-like macro finally.
To the fourth line, the sequence is
    cb_macro_start(Y)
    cb_macro_start(Z)
# enter_macro_context(Z) >> funlike_invocation_p >> cpp_get_token
    cb_macro_end(Y, prev = NULL)
# Y macro is popped from pfile.context.
    cb_end_arg(Z)
# enter_macro_context(Z) end. Z macro is pushed to pfile.context.
    symdb_cpp_token(a)
    cb_macro_end(Z, prev = NULL)
To the fifth line, the sequence is
    cb_macro_start(X)
    cb_macro_start(Z)
    cb_end_arg(Z)
    cb_macro_end(Z)
    cb_macro_end(X)
The fourth line is also breaking cb_macro_start/cb_macro_end pair rule. It
makes my code a little complex. I place a field mo.cascaded to solve it.
// }])>

// GCC Cancel + Cascaded <([{
Consider the case
    #define Z(p) a
    #define Y Z
    #define X Z = 1
    int Y = 1;
    int X;

When cancel encounters cascaded, thing will go even worse.
To the fourth line, the sequence is
    cb_macro_start(Y)
    cb_macro_start(Z)
# enter_macro_context(Z) >> funlike_invocation_p >> cpp_get_token
    cb_macro_end(Y, prev = NULL)
# Y macro is popped from pfile.context. Howver, since the macro is canceled,
# so `funlike_invocation_p >> _cpp_push_token_context' which pushes a NULL
# macro context to pfile.context.
    cb_end_arg(cancel = true)
    cb_macro_end(match-pair to cb_end_arg, prev != NULL)
# So in my cb_macro_end, prev != NULL.
    symdb_cpp_token(`Z' is returned, which is the result of Y macro)
# enter_macro_context(Z) end. Note now, NULL macro context has been pushed to
# pfile.context.
    cb_macro_end(prev = NULL)
    symdb_cpp_token(=)
To the fifth line, the sequence is
    cb_macro_start(X)
    cb_macro_start(Z)
    cb_end_arg(cancel = true)
    cb_macro_end(X, match-pair to cb_end_arg)
    symdb_cpp_token(Z)
    symdb_cpp_token(=)
    symdb_cpp_token(1)
    cb_macro_end
To the fourth line, two cb_macro_start are called and three cb_macro_end are
called.

// Patch Overview <([{
// symdb_enhance_libcpp <([{
Several new callbacks are appended into libpp/include/cpplib.h:cpp_callbacks:
void (*macro_start_expand) (...);
void (*macro_end_arg) (..., bool cancel);
void (*macro_end_expand) (...);
    are used to collect EXPANDED_TOKEN and MACRO_TOKEN.
Note:
1) macro_end_arg is callbacked when a function-like macro ends to collect
its arguments.
2) See section <GCC Cancel Macro Expansion> for more about parameter cancel of
macro_end_arg.
3) macro_{start, end}_expand can be called several times if the macro includes
more macroes in its define clause.
4) Even macro expansion cancel, a macro_end_expand is called too.
void (*start_directive) (...);
void (*end_directive) (...);
void (*directive_token) (...);
    are used to collect ERASED_TOKEN. Meanwhile, directive_token is much
powerful than cpp_get_token since cpp_get_token doesn't output ERASED_TOKEN.
Most code in libcpp directory is surrounding how to implement the callbacks.

A new field -- file_offset is added into cpplib.h:cpp_token, the field is used
to mark every chToken exclusively, it's just like line_map + source_location,
but simpler and to show line/column to user, new script offset2lc(filename,
fileoffset, &line, &column) should be used, so cpp_token::src_loc should be
removed in the furture.  internal.h:_cpp_line_note is also changed to fit with
the purpose.

// Misc. <([{
Gcc defines a default cpp_callbacks::file_change, to listen the callback in my
patch to monitor file depedence, I replace the value in symdb_unit_init and
call the original value in cb_file_change.

New field cpp_token::file_offset breaks the fact the size of cpp_token should
be fit with a cacheline. See section <Patch Overview> for the solution.
